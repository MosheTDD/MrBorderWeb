              Hello there! My name Is Romeo Yofe, I'm 15 years old from Israel.
              Let me tell you a bit about myself! Since I was young I always had this passion<br>
              to code and I always wanted to be this guy who started programming from a very young age but I never actually had the willpower to get up and start doing it by myself.<br>
              At 14 years of age I came to the understanding that the push I was seeking for from outside platforms (Like computer science at school or courses) is not there.<br>
              I've decided to use all my savings to purchase a laptop to start programming on and learning by myself using only what the internet offers me and some very nice people I met in this road.<br>
              I've been coding for about 6 months now in Java and I also done a bit of JS at the start of my road. I code almost every day as of the past 2 months. I'm very dedicated to programming and I'm very motivated about it.<br>
              I absolutely love that feeling when you finish something compile it and it works exactly like you wanted it too, that amazing feeling is what keeps me going with programming.
              And that's a bit about myself.
